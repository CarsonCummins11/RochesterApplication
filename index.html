        Hi! This app utilizes genetic algorithms to figure out how I can better the world.
        A genetic algorithm is a computer program that imitates the process of evolution to
        solve a complex problem such as deciding how I can best improve the world and
        achieve my goals. In this simulation, the dots are put into couples that breed to create
        the next generation, which will be better at achieving my life goals than the previous one.
